##Live URL:
<http://p3.michaelklimek.com>

##Description of Project 3:
Project 3 involved creating two generators; Lorem Ipsum paragraph generator and a Random User generator. The applicaiton needed to be completed utilizing the Laravel Framework, with a focus on using Routes and Views properly. The generators are packages found from Packagist.org that were tied into the project for generating the data. A user can choose how many paragraphs or random users they need generated and the applicaiton will generate them. The numbers allowed range from 1 to 99. This type of application is commonly used with Website Designers who need filler content that doesn't take the focus away from the structure of the site. A description is located on the top of the pages. This was added to give to a better understanding to anyone who is not familiar with these generators.
